        In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the
        best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce,
        cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat that’s
        just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.

        <strong>KEYS TO THIS RECIPE</strong><br />

        <strong>How to Make Lasagna:</strong> To prepare lasagna from scratch,
        you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles
        and cheese before baking. The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce,
        with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with a
        wide variety of vegetables.

      <p class="layer">
        <strong>How to Layer Lasagna:</strong> The basic building formula for
        lasagna is sauce, noodles, more sauce, then cheese. Repeat the
        noodle-sauce-cheese order until the pan is nearly filled, then end with
        sauce and cheese on top.

      <p class="ahead">
        <strong>Make-Ahead Tips for Lasagna:</strong> Both tomato and
        cream-based sauces for lasagna can be made and refrigerated for up to 3
        days before assembling the lasagna. Once baked, the lasagna can be
        refrigerated for up to 4 days. To freeze, bake 30 minutes but do not
        brown, then cool, and freeze for up to 4 weeks. We do not recommend
        assembling and refrigerating or freezing an unbaked lasagna. This will
        adversely affect the texture.
      </p>
      <p class="reheat">
        <strong>How to Reheat Lasagna:</strong> To reheat frozen lasagna,
        defrost, then sprinkle with mozzarella and bake uncovered at 400 degrees
        for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbling on the surface.
        Refrigerated lasagna also can be reheated in a 400-degree oven until
        heated through. Chilled small individual servings can be microwaved.

      <h2>steps to Make</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle
          over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook,
          stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season
          liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and
          cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes
          into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups
          lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley
          with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture.
          Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all
          the ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust
          the meatballs lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the
          hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and
          transfer to the sauce.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer
          to the sauce. Simmer 1½ hours.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta,
          eggs, pecorino Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of the mozzarella.
          Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.
        </li>

        <li>
          Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool
          slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the
          bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles.
          Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of
          the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and
          cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining
          sauce. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30
          minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
