        In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the
        best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce,
        cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat that’s
        just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.

        <strong>KEYS TO THIS RECIPE</strong><br />

        <strong>How to Make Lasagna:</strong> To prepare lasagna from scratch,
        you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles
        and cheese before baking. The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce,
        with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with a
        wide variety of vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Layer Lasagna:</strong> The basic building formula for
        lasagna is sauce, noodles, more sauce, then cheese. Repeat the
        noodle-sauce-cheese order until the pan is nearly filled, then end with
        sauce and cheese on top.

        <strong>Make-Ahead Tips for Lasagna:</strong> Both tomato and
        cream-based sauces for lasagna can be made and refrigerated for up to 3
        days before assembling the lasagna. Once baked, the lasagna can be
        refrigerated for up to 4 days. To freeze, bake 30 minutes but do not
        brown, then cool, and freeze for up to 4 weeks. We do not recommend
        assembling and refrigerating or freezing an unbaked lasagna. This will
        adversely affect the texture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Reheat Lasagna:</strong> To reheat frozen lasagna,
        defrost, then sprinkle with mozzarella and bake uncovered at 400 degrees
        for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbling on the surface.
        Refrigerated lasagna also can be reheated in a 400-degree oven until
        heated through. Chilled small individual servings can be microwaved.
